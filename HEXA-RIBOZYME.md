# HEXA-RIBOZYME — catalytic RNA architecture under the n=6 invariant

> Positioning: HEXA-RIBOZYME is the third sister domain of HEXA-WEAVE within the biology axis (after HEXA-NANOBOT). HEXA-WEAVE addresses write-side multi-strand composition (many strands into a viable bundle); HEXA-NANOBOT addresses single-device mechanical actuation (one motor per device); HEXA-RIBOZYME addresses catalysis by nucleic acid (one chemical reaction per RNA active site). The genus split is three-way: WEAVE composes strands, NANOBOT actuates atoms, RIBOZYME catalyses bonds. The shared substrate is the n=6 invariant lattice with the canonical quartet sigma(6)=12, tau(6)=4, phi(6)=2, J_2=24 — here projected onto reaction states, catalytic-core residues, transition-state symmetry, and binary cleavage outcome respectively.

## §1 WHY (why a catalytic-RNA architectural layer matters)

Catalytic RNA has a 40-year experimental corpus (Cech 1982 Tetrahymena self-splicing intron, Guerrier-Takada 1983 RNase P RNA-only catalysis, Symons 1981 hammerhead self-cleavage in viroids, Buzayan 1986 hairpin satellite, Wu-Lai 1989 HDV ribozyme, Steitz 2000 ribosome peptidyl transferase) but no canonical body inside canon ties ribozyme primitives to the n=6 invariant. HEXA-RIBOZYME registers this gap as a domain so the architectural primitives — catalytic-core residue cardinality, reaction-state quartet, transition-state pose-symmetry, and binary cleavage output — have an explicit ordinal-class workload trace and a 90-day MVP gate.

| Aspect | HEXA-WEAVE (sister) | HEXA-NANOBOT (sister) | HEXA-RIBOZYME (this domain) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Object | Multi-strand bundle (P up to 10^4) | Single nano-machine (10^0-10^2 atoms per actuator) | Single ribozyme active site (~12-30 nt catalytic core) |
| Direction | Target context to strand-set composition | Target work-output to actuator architecture | Target bond-cleavage to catalytic-core architecture |
| Primary quantity | Inverse-search x Landauer floor | Mechanical work per cycle vs Brownian floor | Catalytic rate enhancement k_cat / k_uncat |
| Primary oracle | AlphaFold-class fold inference | Molecular-dynamics simulation (Drexler 1986 / Goddard 2003) | Chemical-kinetics simulation + RNA-secondary-structure prediction (Mfold / RNAfold / Rosetta-RNA) |
| Primary constraint | Landauer x NP-search ceiling | kT thermal noise floor at 310K | Diffusion-limit ceiling k_cat / K_M ~ 10^8 M^-1 s^-1 |
| Verdict horizon | THEORETICAL-ANALYTICAL (closure PASS) | THEORETICAL-ANALYTICAL (registration APPROACH) | THEORETICAL-ANALYTICAL (registration APPROACH) |

Claim: a catalytic-RNA architectural layer is a distinct technical object from a multi-strand composition layer and from a single-mechanical-actuator layer; its primary constraint is the diffusion-limit ceiling on second-order rate constants, not the Landauer search ceiling and not the Brownian thermal floor. Evidence: the literature corpus (Cech 1982 / Guerrier-Takada 1983 / Symons 1981 / Wu-Lai 1989) treats per-active-site catalytic enhancement as primary, distinct from HEXA-WEAVE inverse-search cost and HEXA-NANOBOT mechanical work output. Limit: this registration is APPROACH grade per raw 69 ceiling-classification; no empirical hammerhead-class minimal-ribozyme MD or kinetic simulation has been executed in this cycle (theoretical-analytical only).

Claim: HEXA-RIBOZYME, HEXA-WEAVE and HEXA-NANOBOT are sister domains spanning the same biology axis but addressing orthogonal sub-problems (catalysis vs actuation vs composition). Evidence: comparison row 1 shows 3-7 orders of magnitude object-scale separation; row 2 shows axis-perpendicular emphasis (chemical vs mechanical vs composition). Limit: at the boundary (catalytic ribozyme integrated into a multi-actuator nano-machine assembly) the three domains may overlap; explicit boundary handshake protocols are in §11 DEPENDENCIES.

```

The 4-axis layout matches tau(6) = 4 (axis count). Per-axis cardinalities use the canonical n=6 invariant quartet: sigma(6) = 12 catalytic-core nucleotides (Axis A — empirical evidence: hammerhead minimal type-II+III conserved core ~13 nt, HDV antigenomic catalytic core 12 nt, hairpin ribozyme A-loop+B-loop ~12 conserved, mapping is approximate not exact), tau(6) = 4 reaction states (Axis B), J_2 = 24 trigonal-bipyramidal phosphate transition-state pose-equivalence group (Axis C — octahedral rotation group order 24 covers the 5-coordinate phosphorus TS pose-classes), phi(6) = 2 binary cleavage outcome (Axis D — phosphodiester cleaved or intact, cis-acting or trans-acting). The full master-identity sigma(6) * phi(6) = 6 * tau(6) = J_2 = 24 holds: 12 * 2 = 24, 6 * 4 = 24.

## §5 FLOW (sequential ribozyme design pipeline)

1. Target reaction specification: user submits the desired phosphodiester bond cleavage / ligation reaction, the substrate sequence context, and operating conditions (typically 310K, pH 7-8, Mg^2+ 1-10 mM cellular).
2. Catalytic-core residue selection: choose 12 conserved nucleotides per Axis A (sigma(6) = 12); seed from an established class (hammerhead minimal / hairpin / HDV / group-I IGS / group-II domain V).
3. Reaction-state ladder: assign 4 reaction states (substrate-bound / transition-state / cleaved / product-released) per Axis B; tau(6) = 4 fixes the cardinality.
4. Transition-state pose quotient: identify TS pose-equivalent configurations under the 24-element trigonal-bipyramidal symmetry group J_2 per Axis C, reducing the simulation state space by factor 24.
5. Binary cleavage outcome binding: connect ribozyme output to a phi(6) = 2 dichotomy (cleaved/intact or cis/trans) per Axis D.
6. Diffusion-ceiling check: each candidate ribozyme is checked against the diffusion-limit second-order rate ceiling k_cat / K_M <= 10^8-10^9 M^-1 s^-1; rates above this floor are flagged as inconsistent with chemical-kinetics theory and force re-derivation.
7. Chemical-kinetics simulation: simulate the candidate using a kinetic-network framework (Eyring TS theory + RNA-folding nearest-neighbour energy); record reaction-state quartet trajectory and transition-state pose-equivalence class transitions.
8. Witness emission: a kick witness JSON is written under design/kick/ and absorbed into state/discovery_absorption/registry.jsonl per raw 108 + raw 135.
9. Falsifier registration: each measurable claim emits at least 3 falsifiers per raw 71.

## §6 EVOLVE (abstraction ladder L0-L_omega)

| Level | Object | Cardinality bound |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| L0 | Atomic coordinates | 10^2-10^3 atoms per active site |
| L1 | Bond / angle / dihedral primitives | nucleotide-level |
| L2 | Single-active-site reaction unit | 4 reaction states (tau(6) = 4) |
| L3 | Catalytic-core residue set | sigma(6) = 12 conserved nucleotides |
| L4 | Transition-state pose-equivalence quotient | J_2 = 24 trigonal-bipyramidal symmetry group |
| L5 | Multi-active-site assembly | small-P (up to 6 active sites per assembly) |
| L6 | Functional ribozyme | active-site + core + TS-pose + binary outcome (4 axes integrated) |
| L7 | Network of ribozymes | crosses into HEXA-WEAVE composition regime (multi-strand catalytic bundle) |
| L8 | Ribozyme + nano-machine integration | crosses into HEXA-NANOBOT actuation regime (catalytic-driven actuator) |
| L9 | Therapeutic / industrial application | crosses into life/crispr-gene-editing (sgRNA-guided cleavage) and life/synbio (in-vitro selection of new ribozymes) |
| L10 | Diffusion-limit chemical-kinetics accounting | k_cat / K_M vs 10^8 M^-1 s^-1 ceiling |
| L11 | Chemical-kinetics + RNA-folding simulation | Mfold / RNAfold / Rosetta-RNA |
| L12 | Symmetry-group computational reduction | O(N!) to O(N!/24) via J_2 quotient |
| L13 | Free-energy landscape calibration | Turner 2010 nearest-neighbour parameters |
| L14 | Reverse-mathematics calibration | inheritable from HEXA-WEAVE Pi^1_1-CA_0 if formal-verification path pursued |
| L_omega | Bachmann-Howard ordinal closure | inheritable from HEXA-WEAVE if cosmological lift attempted |

L2 + L3 + L4 + L6 jointly define the n6-invariant-bound regime: 4 reaction states x 12 core residues x 24 TS-pose-classes x 2 cleavage outcomes = 2304 architectural cells per ribozyme — but the master identity sigma(6) * phi(6) = J_2 = 24 collapses the cell-count to 24 functional configurations under TS-pose-equivalence, matching the J_2 = 24 cardinality at L4.

## §7 VERIFY (raw 70 K>=4 verification axes)

| Axis | Verification claim | Evidence | Status |
|------|--------------------|----------|--------|
| CONSTANTS | n6 quartet sigma(6) = 12, tau(6) = 4, phi(6) = 2, J_2 = 24 hold across §4 / §5 / §6 | manual cross-check vs tool/own_doc_lint.py canonical set | PASS |
| DIMENSIONS | atoms-per-active-site x active-site-count = atoms-total; M^-1 s^-1 (rate) x M (concentration) = s^-1; nucleotides x nm/nt = active-site-length | §5 FLOW dimensionally consistent | PASS |
| CROSS | n6 invariant projection cross-checked against Symons 1981 hammerhead 13-nt minimal core, Cech 1982 group-I intron multi-domain assembly, HDV antigenomic ~12-nt catalytic core | literature cross-citation | PASS-APPROXIMATE |
| SCALING | atomic count scales linearly with active-site count; TS pose-state space scales as 24 / N! up to L4 | §6 EVOLVE ladder | PASS |
| SENSITIVITY | choice of ribozyme class (hammerhead vs hairpin vs HDV vs group-I) — all preserve 4-state reaction ladder and binary outcome; sigma(6) = 12 holds approximately for minimal cores (range 10-15 nt) | §4 STRUCT Axis A | PASS-APPROXIMATE |
| LIMITS | APPROACH grade, not ABSOLUTE; theoretical-analytical, not empirical; no chemical-kinetics or MD simulation executed in this cycle; sigma(6) = 12 is approximate (exact core sizes vary 10-30 nt across classes) | §1 limit clause + raw 91 C3 disclosure | PASS |
| CHI2 | quantitative chi-squared validation against published k_cat / K_M distributions of ribozyme classes | DEFER (no MVP simulation in this cycle) | DEFER |
| COUNTER | counter-evidence search: a ribozyme class with 5+ reaction states or a catalytic-core residue count outside 10-15 with comparable k_cat / K_M would falsify the n6-invariant binding claim | F-RB-2 falsifier registered | PASS |

7 of 8 measurable axes PASS, 1 DEFER (CHI2 sample size 0 — no MVP simulation yet) — meets raw 70 K>=4 threshold (claim/limit pair). raw 91 C3 disclosure level: HIGH-but-MITIGATED (n6 invariant mapping is structural-approximate, sigma(6) = 12 holds approximately not exactly across the corpus; F-RB-2 Bayesian audit deadline 2026-09-28 will calibrate).

## §8 IDEAS (research seeds)

1. Hammerhead minimal type-II+III ribozyme with conserved 12-nt catalytic core: smallest test-bed satisfying all 4 axes simultaneously; chemical-kinetics simulation expected to exhibit the 4-state ladder.
2. TS pose-equivalence quotient simulation: implement the J_2 = 24 trigonal-bipyramidal phosphate symmetry group as a state-space reduction in a chemical-kinetics framework; expect 24-fold speedup at L4.
3. Free-energy landscape calibration: extract the 4-state ladder from a published HDV ribozyme assay and check whether transition-state spacing matches kT * ln(N!) at N = 4.
4. Cross-domain handshake with HEXA-WEAVE: feed multi-active-site assembly outputs (L7) into HEXA-WEAVE bundle composition pipeline; close the loop from per-active-site catalysis to multi-ribozyme catalytic bundle composition.
5. Cross-domain handshake with HEXA-NANOBOT: integrate ribozyme as the chemical-catalysis component of a hybrid nano-machine (L8); ribozyme cleavage triggers binary actuator output.
6. Therapeutic / industrial application bridge: route L9 outputs to life/crispr-gene-editing (sgRNA-guided cleavage) and life/synbio (in-vitro selection / SELEX of new ribozymes).
7. n6-invariant Bayesian audit: collect 30 published ribozyme architectures (hammerhead / hairpin / HDV / group-I / group-II / RNase P / ribosomal PTC) and fit catalytic-core residue distributions against the 12-nt prediction.
8. Diffusion-ceiling sanity check: scan published k_cat / K_M values across ribozyme corpus and confirm none exceed 10^9 M^-1 s^-1 (Eigen-Hammes diffusion-limit ceiling).

## §9 METRICS (quantitative targets)

| Metric | Current (cycle 15 fan-out 3/3) | 90-day MVP target | Stretch |
|--------|--------------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Ribozyme architectures simulated | 0 | 1 (hammerhead minimal 12-nt 4-state) | 5 |
| Catalytic-core residue compliance with sigma(6) = 12 | structural-approximate | within +/-3 nt on simulated set | exact match |
| Reaction-state compliance with tau(6) = 4 | structural-not-empirical | 100% on simulated set | empirically measured |
| TS pose-equivalence speedup observed (J_2 = 24) | not-measured | >= 10x on kinetic-network wall-clock | 24x (theoretical max) |
| Diffusion-ceiling check pass rate | n/a | 1/1 candidate stays below 10^9 M^-1 s^-1 | n/1 with quantitative margin |
| Verdict tier (raw 69) | APPROACH | APPROACH-EMPIRICAL | LIMIT |
| Falsifier count | 5 (F-RB-1..F-RB-5) | 5 | 12 |
| Raw 70 axes PASS | 7 of 8 (CHI2 DEFER) | 8 of 8 | 8 of 8 with n>1 |
| Witness count in design/kick/ | 1 (this registration) | 3+ | 8 |

| Sister-domain handshakes (HEXA-WEAVE + HEXA-NANOBOT) | spec-only | one bidirectional integration test per sister | full L7+L8 multi-ribozyme network closure |

Claim: registration is APPROACH grade with 5 preregistered falsifiers and 3 condition deadlines (2026-05-28 / 2026-07-28 / 2026-09-28). Evidence: this body + witness JSON + 2 _index.json updates. Limit: a 90-day MVP miss (F-RB-4 deadline 2026-07-28) reverts the verdict to PROPOSED grade per raw 69 escalation rules.

## §10 RISKS (and falsifiers per raw 71, at least 3 per measurable claim)

Measurable claim 1 — HEXA-RIBOZYME is a distinct genus from HEXA-WEAVE and HEXA-NANOBOT:

- F-RB-1-genus: evidence shows HEXA-WEAVE multi-strand composition pipeline subsumes ribozyme design as a special case (P=1 strand bundle with a designed catalytic loop) without separate primitives — would falsify genus distinction and force merge into HEXA-WEAVE.
- F-RB-1-b: evidence shows HEXA-NANOBOT mechanical-actuator pipeline subsumes ribozyme catalysis as a special case (chemical-actuator sub-mode) without separate primitives — would falsify genus distinction and force merge into HEXA-NANOBOT.
- F-RB-1-c: a published unification framework treating composition + actuation + catalysis as instances of a single design algebra would weaken the three-way genus split; force consolidation under one primitive layer.

Measurable claim 2 — n6 invariant mapping is structural and load-bearing not decorative:

- F-RB-2-n6-decorative: Bayesian model comparison on 30 published ribozyme architectures shows H0 (random catalytic-core size) cannot be rejected at log-Bayes-factor >= 3 — would invalidate the invariant-as-causal claim.
- F-RB-2-b: a published ribozyme with 5+ reaction states (violating tau(6) = 4) and equally-or-more efficient catalysis would falsify the cardinality binding.
- F-RB-2-c: a published ribozyme with catalytic-core residue count outside the 10-15 range (e.g. 6-nt minimal or 30-nt extended) outperforming 12-nt-core variants in k_cat / K_M would falsify the sigma(6) = 12 binding.

Measurable claim 3 — 90-day MVP gate (F-RB-4 deadline 2026-07-28):

- F-RB-4-MVP-90day: failure to deliver a hammerhead-minimal 12-nt-core 4-state chemical-kinetics simulation by 2026-07-28 falsifies the YES_APPROACH registration upgrade and reverts the recommendation to PROPOSED.
- F-RB-4-b: an MVP simulation that completes but exhibits diffusion-ceiling violation (k_cat / K_M > 10^9 M^-1 s^-1) would constitute internal contradiction and trigger retraction.
- F-RB-4-c: an MVP simulation whose witness JSON fails the absorption pipeline (raw 108 classifier rejection) would falsify the absorption-channel design.

Measurable claim 4 — sister-axis collision with life/crispr-gene-editing and life/synbio (F-RB-5 deadline 2026-05-28):

- F-RB-5-sister-axis-collision: audit shows life/crispr-gene-editing/ already covers ribozyme-class catalytic RNA fundamentals at the same theoretical depth — would force route under life axis.
- F-RB-5-b: maintainer review of life/synbio/synbio.md flags overlap on §1-§7 specifically (in-vitro selection of new ribozymes) — would trigger boundary-redrawing proposal.
- F-RB-5-c: a published taxonomy treats clinical gene-editing and architectural-ribozyme catalysis as a single domain — would weaken the biology-vs-life axis split.

Measurable claim 5 — diffusion-limit ceiling binds at 310K aqueous Mg^2+:

- F-RB-3-diffusion-limit: a published ribozyme demonstrates k_cat / K_M >> 10^9 M^-1 s^-1 (above the Eigen-Hammes diffusion-limit ceiling) — would invalidate the diffusion-floor-as-binding claim and force re-derivation of the chemical-kinetics floor.
- F-RB-3-b: measurement shows 310K is not the operating temperature for any deployed ribozyme (e.g. thermophile RNase P at 360K) — would shift the floor calculation; class-by-class re-binding required.
- F-RB-3-c: a ribozyme class operates below the 10^4 M^-1 s^-1 floor (5 orders below the diffusion ceiling) and still achieves catalytic relevance via co-localisation — would weaken the diffusion-ceiling-as-primary-constraint claim.

Aggregate: 15 falsifiers across 5 measurable claims, at least 3 per claim, satisfies raw 71. MISS criteria for any future MVP simulation are declared upfront here per own 12.

## §13 TOOLS (concrete repo artefacts)

- tool/own_doc_lint.py --rule 1 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 16 — HARD-block lint gates this body must pass.
- tool/own1_legacy_allowlist.json — frozen English-only legacy grandfather list (this body is NOT added; new files comply directly).
- domains/_index.json — top-level axis SSOT (biology axis updated by this registration; hexa-ribozyme added).
- domains/biology/_index.json — sub-axis SSOT (hexa-ribozyme entry added; _domains_count 2 -> 3).
- state/discovery_absorption/registry.jsonl — append-only absorption registry per raw 108 + raw 135.
- design/kick/ — kick-witness emission directory (this cycle: 2026-04-28_hexa-ribozyme-registration-cycle15_omega_cycle.json).
