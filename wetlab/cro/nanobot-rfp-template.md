## Subject

`Pilot wet-lab engagement RFP — DNA-origami nanobot 12-vertex actuation`

## Body

Dear [CRO contact],

We are developing a 12-vertex DNA-origami nanobot under the **hexa-weave
invariant-lattice framework** (n=6 master identity; cuboctahedron 12-vertex
+ truncated-icosahedron alternative skeleton). In-silico phase complete:
4-state actuation simulation (work 50 kT, J₂=24 pose-canon), C0d dual-
skeleton verification, L6→L7-L9 acceptance contract test all PASS. We
seek an in-vitro pilot for AFM/cryo-EM structural confirmation of the
folded state.

### Pilot scope (Phase 1, ~4 months)

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Construct | M13-scaffolded DNA origami; 12-vertex cuboctahedron geometry (cadnano design delivered) |
| Staples | ~200 oligo staples (sequences delivered as ordering sheet) |
| Folding | Thermal annealing 65 °C → 25 °C / 18h in 12 mM MgCl₂ TE buffer |
| Read-out | (1) AFM imaging of folded structures (n ≥ 100 individual particles); (2) cryo-EM single-particle reconstruction (resolution target ≥ 15 Å); (3) gel electrophoresis fold yield % |
| Required precision | Yield ≥ 70%; mean particle diameter within 10% of design |
| Deliverables | Raw AFM images + cryo-EM micrographs + 3D reconstruction (mrc) + summary report |
| Timeline | M1: staple synthesis; M2: folding; M3: AFM screen; M4: cryo-EM session + reconstruction |
| Budget cap | **$XX K** (placeholder — fill before send) |

### Read-out priorities

1. **12-vertex geometry confirmed** (σ(6)=12 invariant)
2. **J₂=24 pose-distinguishability**: at least 24 distinct rotational poses identifiable in AFM (manual or auto-classification)
3. **Work-cycle feasibility**: actuation between "compact" and "extended" states under ATP-fuel proxy (e.g., DNA strand-displacement trigger)

### What we ask in your reply

- [ ] DNA-origami folding experience (last 5 years; published constructs preferred)
- [ ] AFM resolution capability (lateral ≤ 3 nm; vertical ≤ 0.5 nm)
- [ ] Cryo-EM access (in-house or partner facility); session lead time
- [ ] Estimated timeline + budget for the Phase 1 pilot above
- [ ] NDA + MTA terms (cadnano design + staple sequences are confidential pre-publication)
- [ ] References to similar nanobot / structural DNA nano projects
